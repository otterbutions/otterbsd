This is a post-installer script, it works on FreeBSD 14.2-RELEASE (atleast for me)

Don't make a user, this will do it for you, the only thing you need to do is connect to a network and install git.

This will ask you what's your favorite color (for highlighting, wm and wallpaper, changable through ~/.config/otterwm/change-color
What drm-kmod module to load, and that's pretty much it.

This does not require any gnome-theme engines besides the default, it doesn't install lxappearance or any of the sort, system will be in japanese and ibus will allow you to choose from US, JA and mozc layouts
